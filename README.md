# My Portfolio (aka Girdika Godwin's Portfolio)

## Description

The following porfolio showcases my work and my abilities through examples of my work. This includes the portfolio itself. 

Having a portfolio is important considering that it is an efficient way for employers to see what you are capable of, with examples, instead of just iterating what you are good at. 

Building my own portfolio was pretty challenging. I am still working on understanding positioning in CSS and how the flex property can be used. Media Queries is also something, I realize, I need to work on as well.
